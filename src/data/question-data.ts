    question: "Is it safe to dye my hair while pregnant?",
    answer: "Hair dye is generally safe during pregnancy, especially after the first trimester.

    question: "Why do I have morning sickness all day?",
    answer: "Despite its name, morning sickness can occur any time of day. It's caused by rapidly rising hormone levels, particularly hCG and estrogen.

  },
  {
    id: 'q008',
    question: "Can stress harm my baby?",
    answer: "While occasional stress is normal and won't harm your baby, chronic severe stress may affect your pregnancy.

  },
   {
    id: 'q009',
    question: "Is it safe to sleep on my back during pregnancy?",
    answer: "After the first trimester, it's best to avoid sleeping on your back for extended periods.

Use pillows for support and comfort.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q010',
    question: "Can I take a hot bath or use a hot tub?",
    answer: "Hot baths are fine, but avoid water that's uncomfortably hot. Hot tubs and saunas should be avoided as they can raise your core body temperature too high, which may be harmful to your baby. Stick to warm (not hot) baths and limit time to 10-15 minutes.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q011',
    question: "Will flying hurt my baby?",
    answer: "Flying is generally safe during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester. The cabin pressure and altitude won't harm your baby. However, avoid flying after 36 weeks (32 weeks for multiples) and during the first trimester if you have severe morning sickness or bleeding.",

    id: 'q012',
    question: "Do I need to avoid cats during pregnancy?",
    answer: "You don't need to avoid cats, but you should avoid changing litter boxes due to toxoplasmosis risk. If you must clean the litter box, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Indoor cats pose less risk than outdoor cats. Your feline friend can absolutely stay part of the family!",

    id: 'q013',
    question: "Can I eat soft cheeses?",
    answer: "Avoid unpasteurized soft cheeses like brie, camembert, feta, and blue cheese, as they may contain listeria bacteria. However, pasteurized versions of these cheeses are safe. Always check labels and when in doubt, choose hard cheeses like cheddar or Swiss, which are always safe.",

    id: 'q014',
    question: "Why are my emotions so intense?",
    answer: "Pregnancy hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, significantly affect your mood and emotional responses. Add physical discomfort, life changes, and anticipation about becoming a parent, and it's completely normal to feel more emotional. This usually improves in the second trimester.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q015',
    question: "Can I eat deli meat?",
    answer: "Deli meats can contain listeria, which is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. If you want to eat deli meat, heat it until it's steaming hot (165°F) to kill any bacteria. Alternatively, choose shelf-stable or canned meats, or stick to freshly cooked meats.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q016',
    question: "Is it normal to have weird dreams during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes! Vivid, strange dreams are very common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, interrupted sleep patterns, and subconscious processing of your changing life. Many women dream about their baby, labor, or parenting scenarios. These dreams are completely normal and harmless.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q017',
    question: "Can I get a massage during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Prenatal massage is wonderful and safe when performed by a trained therapist. It can reduce stress, ease muscle tension, and improve circulation.

  },
  {
    id: 'q018',
    question: "Why do I need to take folic acid?",
    answer: "Folic acid prevents neural tube defects like spina bifida. Since these defects occur very early in pregnancy (often before you know you're pregnant), it's recommended that all women of childbearing age take 400-800mcg daily. During pregnancy, you need 600-800mcg daily.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q019',
    question: "Can I eat fish during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Fish is excellent for pregnancy! It provides protein and omega-3 fatty acids crucial for your baby's brain development. Choose low-mercury options like salmon, sardines, anchovies, and shrimp. Limit high-mercury fish like shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Aim for 8-12 ounces of safe fish weekly.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q020',
    question: "Is it true that heartburn means my baby will have lots of hair?",
    answer: "This old wives' tale actually has some scientific backing! The hormones that relax your digestive system (causing heartburn) are the same ones that can stimulate fetal hair growth. However, heartburn severity doesn't directly correlate with hair amount, and many babies with lots of hair don't cause heartburn.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q021',
    question: "Can I use essential oils during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Some essential oils are safe during pregnancy, while others should be avoided. Generally safe options include lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang when properly diluted.

  },
  {
    id: 'q022',
    question: "Why am I so tired in the first trimester?",
    answer: "First trimester fatigue is completely normal and often overwhelming. Your body is working incredibly hard to support your growing baby - creating the placenta, increasing blood volume, and producing pregnancy hormones. This usually improves significantly in the second trimester.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q023',
    question: "Can I paint the nursery while pregnant?",
    answer: "Painting with latex (water-based) paints in well-ventilated areas is generally safe during pregnancy. Avoid oil-based paints and spray paints, which contain stronger chemicals. If possible, let someone else do the painting, but if you must paint, wear gloves, take frequent breaks, and ensure good ventilation.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q024',
    question: "Is it safe to go to the dentist during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes! Dental care is important during pregnancy. Routine cleanings and necessary treatments are safe, especially in the second trimester. Pregnancy hormones can increase your risk of gum disease, so don't skip your dental checkups. Always inform your dentist that you're pregnant.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q025',
    question: "Can I eat eggs during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Eggs are excellent during pregnancy - they're a complete protein and contain choline, which supports your baby's brain development. Just make sure they're fully cooked to avoid salmonella. This means avoiding runny yolks, homemade mayonnaise, or raw cookie dough made with eggs.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q026',
    question: "Why do I have to pee so often?",
    answer: "Frequent urination is normal throughout pregnancy but for different reasons. Early on, pregnancy hormones increase blood flow to your kidneys. Later, your growing baby presses on your bladder. This is completely normal, though you should mention any burning or pain to your doctor.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q027',
    question: "Can I lift heavy things while pregnant?",
    answer: "The definition of \"heavy\" changes as your pregnancy progresses. In early pregnancy, you can generally continue your normal activities. Later, avoid lifting more than 25-30 pounds, and always lift with your legs, not your back. Listen to your body, and don't lift anything that causes strain or discomfort.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q028',
    question: "Is it normal to have bleeding during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Light spotting can be normal, especially in early pregnancy (implantation bleeding) or after intercourse.

  },
  {
    id: 'q029',
    question: "Can I get my nails done during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes! Manicures and pedicures are safe during pregnancy. Nail salons should be well-ventilated, and you should make sure all instruments are properly sterilized. If you're concerned about chemical exposure, consider going to salons that use non-toxic polishes or bring your own polish.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q030',
    question: "Why do I crave strange food combinations?",
    answer: "Pregnancy cravings are likely caused by hormonal changes, nutritional needs, and heightened senses of taste and smell. Sometimes cravings indicate a nutritional need (like craving red meat when you need iron), but often they're just random! As long as you're eating a balanced diet overall, occasional strange cravings are fine.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q031',
    question: "Can I take medicine for headaches?",
    answer: "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is generally safe for headaches during pregnancy. Avoid ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and aspirin unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Try natural remedies first: rest, hydration, cold or warm compress, and gentle neck massage. If headaches are severe or frequent, consult your healthcare provider.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q032',
    question: "Is it safe to have sex during pregnancy?",
    answer: "For most women, sex during pregnancy is completely safe and won't hurt your baby. Your baby is well-protected by the amniotic sac and your cervix. You may need to try different positions as your belly grows. However, if you have certain complications or your doctor has advised against it, abstain from sexual activity.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q033',
    question: "Can I eat honey during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes, honey is safe for you during pregnancy. The concern about botulism from honey only applies to babies under 12 months old because their immune systems aren't fully developed. Your digestive system can handle any botulism spores that might be present in honey.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q034',
    question: "Why do my feet hurt and swell?",
    answer: "Foot pain and swelling are common due to increased blood volume, pressure from your growing uterus, and the hormone relaxin loosening your ligaments. Elevate your feet when possible, wear comfortable shoes, avoid standing for long periods, and consider compression socks. Some swelling is normal, but sudden severe swelling needs medical attention.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q035',
    question: "Can I eat peanuts during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Unless you're allergic to peanuts, eating them during pregnancy is safe and may actually help prevent your child from developing a peanut allergy. Peanuts provide protein, healthy fats, and folate. The old advice to avoid peanuts during pregnancy has been reversed based on new research.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q036',
    question: "Is it normal to have discharge during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes, increased vaginal discharge is normal during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and increased blood flow to the pelvic area. Normal discharge is clear or milky white and doesn't have a strong odor. However, if discharge is yellow, green, or has a strong smell, or if you have itching or burning, see your healthcare provider.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q037',
    question: "Can I use sunscreen during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Sun protection is important during pregnancy as hormonal changes can make you more prone to melasma (pregnancy mask). Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are excellent choices as they sit on top of your skin rather than being absorbed.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q038',
    question: "Why do I feel short of breath?",
    answer: "Shortness of breath is common, especially in later pregnancy, as your growing uterus pushes up on your diaphragm. Early in pregnancy, progesterone increases your breathing rate. Usually, this is normal, but if you experience severe breathlessness, chest pain, or rapid heartbeat, contact your healthcare provider immediately.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q039',
    question: "Can I eat ice cream during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes! Ice cream is safe during pregnancy as long as it's made from pasteurized milk and eggs. However, avoid soft-serve ice cream from machines that might not be properly cleaned, and be mindful of your overall sugar intake. Enjoy occasional treats as part of a balanced diet.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q040',
    question: "Is it true that pregnancy lasts 10 months, not 9?",
    answer: "Pregnancy is actually about 40 weeks from your last menstrual period, which equals about 10 lunar months or 9 calendar months. The confusion comes from different ways of counting. Most healthcare providers count pregnancy in weeks rather than months for more accuracy in tracking development and due dates.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q041',
    question: "Can I get vaccinations during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Some vaccines are safe and recommended during pregnancy (like the flu shot and Tdap), while others should be avoided (like live vaccines such as MMR). The flu vaccine protects both you and your baby, while the Tdap vaccine (given in the third trimester) provides protection against pertussis. Always discuss vaccines with your healthcare provider.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q042',
    question: "Why do I have strange metallic taste in my mouth?",
    answer: "A metallic taste, called dysgeusia, is common in early pregnancy due to hormonal changes, particularly increased estrogen levels. This usually improves after the first trimester. Try citrus fruits, mints, or brushing your teeth more frequently to help minimize the taste.",
  },

    id: 'q043',
    question: "Can I eat spicy food during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Spicy food is generally safe during pregnancy and won't hurt your baby. However, it might worsen heartburn or indigestion, which are already common during pregnancy.

  },
  {
    id: 'q044',
    question: "Is it normal to snore during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes, pregnancy snoring is very common due to increased blood flow causing nasal congestion, weight gain, and hormonal changes. Try sleeping with your head elevated, using nasal strips, or a humidifier. However, loud snoring with breathing pauses could indicate sleep apnea and should be discussed with your healthcare provider.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q045',
    question: "Can I use bug spray during pregnancy?",
    answer: "EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 are safe when used as directed during pregnancy. These protect against mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika virus, which can be harmful to your baby. Apply to exposed skin and clothing, and wash off when you come indoors.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q046',
    question: "Why do I have leg cramps at night?",
    answer: "Leg cramps are common in the second and third trimesters, possibly due to increased weight, circulation changes, and pressure on blood vessels. Calcium or magnesium deficiency might also contribute. Gentle stretching before bed, staying hydrated, and prenatal yoga can help prevent cramps.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q047',
    question: "Can I eat raw cookie dough or cake batter?",
    answer: "It's best to avoid raw cookie dough and cake batter during pregnancy due to the risk of salmonella from raw eggs and E. coli from raw flour. If you're craving something sweet, try cookie dough made specifically to be eaten raw (with heat-treated flour and pasteurized eggs) or wait for the baked version!",
  },
  {
    id: 'q048',
    question: "Is it safe to get an X-ray during pregnancy?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q049',
    question: "Why do I have skin changes during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Pregnancy hormones cause various skin changes. The \"pregnancy glow\" comes from increased blood flow and oil production. You might also experience melasma (dark patches), a dark line down your belly (linea nigra), or stretch marks. Most of these changes fade after delivery, though some may be permanent.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q050',
    question: "Can I eat leftover food during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Leftover food is safe if it's been properly stored and reheated to steaming hot (165°F). Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours of cooking and use within 3-4 days.
