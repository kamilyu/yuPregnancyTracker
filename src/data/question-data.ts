    question: "Is it safe to dye my hair while pregnant?",
    answer: "Hair dye is generally safe during pregnancy, especially after the first trimester.

    id: 'q008',
    question: "Can stress harm my baby?",
    answer: "While occasional stress is normal and won't harm your baby, chronic severe stress may affect your pregnancy.

   {
    id: 'q009',
    question: "Is it safe to sleep on my back during pregnancy?",

    question: "Why are my emotions so intense?",
    answer: "Pregnancy hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, significantly affect your mood and emotional responses.

  {
    id: 'q018',
    question: "Why do I need to take folic acid?",
    answer: "Folic acid prevents neural tube defects like spina bifida. Since these defects occur very early in pregnancy (often before you know you're pregnant), it's recommended that all women of childbearing age take 400-800mcg daily. During pregnancy, you need 600-800mcg daily.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q019',
    question: "Can I eat fish during pregnancy?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q020',
    question: "Is it true that heartburn means my baby will have lots of hair?",
    answer: "This old wives' tale actually has some scientific backing! The hormones that relax your digestive system (causing heartburn) are the same ones that can stimulate fetal hair growth.

  },
  {
    id: 'q021',
    question: "Can I use essential oils during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Some essential oils are safe during pregnancy, while others should be avoided. Generally safe options include lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang when properly diluted.

  },
  {
    id: 'q022',
    question: "Why am I so tired in the first trimester?",
    answer: "First trimester fatigue is completely normal and often overwhelming. Your body is working incredibly hard to support your growing baby - creating the placenta, increasing blood volume, and producing pregnancy hormones. This usually improves significantly in the second trimester.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q023',
    question: "Can I paint the nursery while pregnant?",
    answer: "Painting with latex (water-based) paints in well-ventilated areas is generally safe during pregnancy. Avoid oil-based paints and spray paints, which contain stronger chemicals.

  },
  {
    id: 'q026',
    question: "Why do I have to pee so often?",
    answer: "Frequent urination is normal throughout pregnancy but for different reasons. Early on, pregnancy hormones increase blood flow to your kidneys. Later, your growing baby presses on your bladder. This is completely normal, though you should mention any burning or pain to your doctor.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q027',
    question: "Can I lift heavy things while pregnant?",
    answer: "The definition of \"heavy\" changes as your pregnancy progresses. In early pregnancy, you can generally continue your normal activities. Later, avoid lifting more than 25-30 pounds, and always lift with your legs, not your back. Listen to your body, and don't lift anything that causes strain or discomfort.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q028',
    question: "Is it normal to have bleeding during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Light spotting can be normal, especially in early pregnancy (implantation bleeding) or after intercourse.

  },
  {
    id: 'q030',
    question: "Why do I crave strange food combinations?",
    answer: "Pregnancy cravings are likely caused by hormonal changes, nutritional needs, and heightened senses of taste and smell.

  },
  {
    id: 'q031',
    question: "Can I take medicine for headaches?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q032',
    question: "Is it safe to have sex during pregnancy?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q033',
    question: "Can I eat honey during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Yes, honey is safe for you during pregnancy. The concern about botulism from honey only applies to babies under 12 months old because their immune systems aren't fully developed. Your digestive system can handle any botulism spores that might be present in honey.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q034',
    question: "Why do my feet hurt and swell?",
    answer: "Foot pain and swelling are common due to increased blood volume, pressure from your growing uterus, and the hormone relaxin loosening your ligaments.

Some swelling is normal, but sudden severe swelling needs medical attention.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q035',
    question: "Can I eat peanuts during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Unless you're allergic to peanuts, eating them during pregnancy is safe and may actually help prevent your child from developing a peanut allergy.

  },
  {
    id: 'q036',
    question: "Is it normal to have discharge during pregnancy?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q037',
    question: "Can I use sunscreen during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Sun protection is important during pregnancy as hormonal changes can make you more prone to melasma (pregnancy mask). Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.

  },
  {
    id: 'q038',
    question: "Why do I feel short of breath?",
    answer: "Shortness of breath is common, especially in later pregnancy, as your growing uterus pushes up on your diaphragm. Early in pregnancy, progesterone increases your breathing rate.

  {
    id: 'q039',
    question: "Can I eat ice cream during pregnancy?",

    question: "Is it true that pregnancy lasts 10 months, not 9?",
    answer: "Pregnancy is actually about 40 weeks from your last menstrual period, which equals about 10 lunar months or 9 calendar months. The confusion comes from different ways of counting. Most healthcare providers count pregnancy in weeks rather than months for more accuracy in tracking development and due dates.",
  },
  {
    id: 'q041',
    question: "Can I get vaccinations during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Some vaccines are safe and recommended during pregnancy (like the flu shot and Tdap), while others should be avoided (like live vaccines such as MMR).

    id: 'q042',
    question: "Why do I have strange metallic taste in my mouth?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q044',
    question: "Is it normal to snore during pregnancy?",

  },
  {
    id: 'q046',
    question: "Why do I have leg cramps at night?",
    answer: "Leg cramps are common in the second and third trimesters, possibly due to increased weight, circulation changes, and pressure on blood vessels.

  },
  {
    id: 'q047',
    question: "Can I eat raw cookie dough or cake batter?",
    answer: "It's best to avoid raw cookie dough and cake batter during pregnancy due to the risk of salmonella from raw eggs and E. coli from raw flour.

  },
  {
    id: 'q048',

  },
  {
    id: 'q049',
    question: "Why do I have skin changes during pregnancy?",
    answer: "Pregnancy hormones cause various skin changes. The \"pregnancy glow\" comes from increased blood flow and oil production.

  {
    id: 'q051',
    question: "Is it normal to feel dizzy during pregnancy?",

    id: 'q056',
    question: "Can I get a tattoo while pregnant?",
